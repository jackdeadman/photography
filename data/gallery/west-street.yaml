alt: Black and White photo of a man looking into West Street. Taken from a reflection
  in a window.
description: One of my favourite types of photography is street photography. I like
  the story this one tells, West Street is often a chaotic place at night. Here we
  can see a gentleman looking into the street, observing the world. The other part
  of the frame hints at the chaos he could be looking at. But nothing is really clear,
  much like trying to comprehend the people of West Street!
