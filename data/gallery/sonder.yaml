alt: A picture taken from the old bridge in Bakewell. The view looks upon the river
  showing several people with their own lives. A man with his shirt off at the front,
  some dog walkers, a man fishing, a lady sitting on a bench on her own and some people
  with their dog in the water.

  I went to Bakewell for a much needed day off,
  I decided to challenge myself by only using my 22mm lens. When I finished the day,
  I didn't feel like I really took any good shots. Then I saw this one, it's quite
  nice to look at first glance, but it is also a bit deeper. I enjoy zooming into
  this photo (you might need to download the full resolution version) and having a glimpse into the lives of the different people. E.g., the man on his phone, the man fishing and the cute doggy in the background playing in the water."
