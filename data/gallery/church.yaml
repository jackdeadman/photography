alt: A picture of an empty cathedral with a man about to start a service in front
  of no one.
description: A picture of a Cathedral near Fargate in Sheffield. I like the story
  it tells with a service about to begin and a sign of the times. If you look closely
  you can see the man is wearing a mask and that the building is empty.
